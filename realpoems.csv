0,"The rivers are dry, the oceans rise,
A choking earth beneath the skies.
The fish no longer swim in streams,
And water is the rarest dream.

We built our cities on borrowed ground,
Where drought and flood have both been found.
Yet still, we fight for what’s been lost,
Not seeing that we pay the cost.","['The rivers are dry, the oceans rise,\nA choking earth beneath the skies.\nThe fish no longer swim in streams,\nAnd water is the rarest dream.', 'We built our cities on borrowed ground,\nWhere drought and flood have both been found.\nYet still, we fight for what’s been lost,\nNot seeing that we pay the cost.']"

There’s a man who hides behind his walls,
Chasing shadows that echo his calls.
The weight of silence fills his space,
A world outside, he cannot face.

The sun still rises every day,
But darkness never seems to fade away.
The struggle for light—so real, so true—
A battle fought by more than a few.","['\nThere’s a man who hides behind his walls,\nChasing shadows that echo his calls.\nThe weight of silence fills his space,\nA world outside, he cannot face.', 'The sun still rises every day,\nBut darkness never seems to fade away.\nThe struggle for light—so real, so true—\nA battle fought by more than a few.']"

We walk the same streets, breathe the same air,
But some of us breathe in despair.
Where the color of skin or the place you’re born,
Defines the chances for which you're sworn.

A world built on ancient lies,
Where the rich grow fat and the poor subsides.
The echo rings, and none can deny,
That some will fall and others fly.","[""\nWe walk the same streets, breathe the same air,\nBut some of us breathe in despair.\nWhere the color of skin or the place you’re born,\nDefines the chances for which you're sworn."", 'A world built on ancient lies,\nWhere the rich grow fat and the poor subsides.\nThe echo rings, and none can deny,\nThat some will fall and others fly.']"

A child stares at an empty plate,
Dreaming of food while they wait.
The hunger gnaws and steals their pride,
A pang so deep it cannot hide.

In a world with plenty to share,
Why is there always someone who cares?
As we waste and waste, the truth remains—
The empty plate is their only gain.","['\nA child stares at an empty plate,\nDreaming of food while they wait.\nThe hunger gnaws and steals their pride,\nA pang so deep it cannot hide.', 'In a world with plenty to share,\nWhy is there always someone who cares?\nAs we waste and waste, the truth remains—\nThe empty plate is their only gain.']"

They whisper in the corners, unseen, unheard,
The homeless, the broken, the lost in the dirt.
Forgotten by the world that walks by so fast,
Caught in a system that was never meant to last.

But they still have stories, they still have names,
Lives left behind in society's games.
If you listen close, you'll hear their plea—
Don’t forget them, don’t let them be.","['\nThey whisper in the corners, unseen, unheard,\nThe homeless, the broken, the lost in the dirt.\nForgotten by the world that walks by so fast,\nCaught in a system that was never meant to last.', ""But they still have stories, they still have names,\nLives left behind in society's games.\nIf you listen close, you'll hear their plea—\nDon’t forget them, don’t let them be.""]"

A look, a word, a silent thought,
The prejudice that we’ve all been taught.
We wear the veil, and never see,
The hurt we cause, the pain we free.

For in the eyes of those we fear,
Lies something beautiful, something dear.
But as long as we choose not to know,
Prejudice will continue to grow.","['\nA look, a word, a silent thought,\nThe prejudice that we’ve all been taught.\nWe wear the veil, and never see,\nThe hurt we cause, the pain we free.', 'For in the eyes of those we fear,\nLies something beautiful, something dear.\nBut as long as we choose not to know,\nPrejudice will continue to grow.']"

We live in luxury, we live in ease,
But someone pays for our desires and pleas.
From sweat-stained hands to polluted skies,
The cost of comfort is what we deny.

We close our eyes, we shut the door,
Ignoring the toll that comes to the poor.
But every purchase, every indulgent thought,
Has a price that can never be bought.","['\nWe live in luxury, we live in ease,\nBut someone pays for our desires and pleas.\nFrom sweat-stained hands to polluted skies,\nThe cost of comfort is what we deny.', 'We close our eyes, we shut the door,\nIgnoring the toll that comes to the poor.\nBut every purchase, every indulgent thought,\nHas a price that can never be bought.']"

It’s a battle no one sees,
Fought within the mind, with silent pleas.
A scream that stays locked in a chest,
A weight too heavy, a heart oppressed.

The world moves on, unaware,
Of the chains that bind, the silent despair.
It’s not always visible, this fight we wage—
Mental health is not a cage.","['\nIt’s a battle no one sees,\nFought within the mind, with silent pleas.\nA scream that stays locked in a chest,\nA weight too heavy, a heart oppressed.', 'The world moves on, unaware,\nOf the chains that bind, the silent despair.\nIt’s not always visible, this fight we wage—\nMental health is not a cage.']"

The waves crash in, but not as they should,
With plastic and waste washing up to the wood.
We traded life for convenience,
But now the ocean screams its grievance.

Turtles are tangled, birds are bound,
Our garbage floats where beauty was found.
The ocean pleads with every tide—
Clean up the mess we’ve left behind.","['\nThe waves crash in, but not as they should,\nWith plastic and waste washing up to the wood.\nWe traded life for convenience,\nBut now the ocean screams its grievance.', 'Turtles are tangled, birds are bound,\nOur garbage floats where beauty was found.\nThe ocean pleads with every tide—\nClean up the mess we’ve left behind.']"

A soldier stands with weary eyes,
A world of blood, a sea of lies.
Fighting battles not of their choice,
Echoing a call without a voice.

The land is scarred, the people mourn,
Lives shattered by the war they’re born.
The price is paid in endless cries,
By those who’ll never see the skies.","['\nA soldier stands with weary eyes,\nA world of blood, a sea of lies.\nFighting battles not of their choice,\nEchoing a call without a voice.', 'The land is scarred, the people mourn,\nLives shattered by the war they’re born.\nThe price is paid in endless cries,\nBy those who’ll never see the skies.']"

The world beyond is full of light,
But we’ve buried our faces in screens at night.
We scroll and scroll, but never find,
A way to ease the heart or mind.

The world is shrinking, yet we’re alone,
Disconnected in a digital zone.
We talk but never truly speak,
Lost in the noise, too tired to seek.","['\nThe world beyond is full of light,\nBut we’ve buried our faces in screens at night.\nWe scroll and scroll, but never find,\nA way to ease the heart or mind.', 'The world is shrinking, yet we’re alone,\nDisconnected in a digital zone.\nWe talk but never truly speak,\nLost in the noise, too tired to seek.']"

The trees once stood, tall and proud,
Now their leaves are lost in a dying cloud.
The earth is warming, the air is thin,
And nature fights a losing win.

We cut and burn, destroy and drain,
Until there’s nothing left to sustain.
But if we don’t change, if we don’t see,
The world will wither, and so will we.","['\nThe trees once stood, tall and proud,\nNow their leaves are lost in a dying cloud.\nThe earth is warming, the air is thin,\nAnd nature fights a losing win.', 'We cut and burn, destroy and drain,\nUntil there’s nothing left to sustain.\nBut if we don’t change, if we don’t see,\nThe world will wither, and so will we.']"

Behind the smile, a storm does brew,
A heart that’s bruised, a soul askew.
We wear our masks, we hide our pain,
A world of hurt, in silence, remains.

But the struggle’s there, it’s real, it’s true—
We all are fighting battles we can’t undo.
So before you judge, before you say,
Remember that everyone has their own way.","['\nBehind the smile, a storm does brew,\nA heart that’s bruised, a soul askew.\nWe wear our masks, we hide our pain,\nA world of hurt, in silence, remains.', 'But the struggle’s there, it’s real, it’s true—\nWe all are fighting battles we can’t undo.\nSo before you judge, before you say,\nRemember that everyone has their own way.']"

The clock keeps ticking, minute by minute,
While we ignore the state we're in it.
The climate shifts, the ice melts away,
Yet we keep pretending we have more time to play.

The earth is warning, the signs are clear,
But we stand still, consumed by fear.
The clock is ticking, louder now,
And soon it will be too late to bow.","[""\nThe clock keeps ticking, minute by minute,\nWhile we ignore the state we're in it.\nThe climate shifts, the ice melts away,\nYet we keep pretending we have more time to play."", 'The earth is warning, the signs are clear,\nBut we stand still, consumed by fear.\nThe clock is ticking, louder now,\nAnd soon it will be too late to bow.']"

The weight of debt, it pulls you down,
A never-ending, heavy crown.
With every bill, with every call,
You wonder if you’ll lose it all.

The cycle’s endless, the struggle real,
A life spent fighting just to heal.
But in the end, you break, you bend,
And hope for the day this cycle ends.","['\nThe weight of debt, it pulls you down,\nA never-ending, heavy crown.\nWith every bill, with every call,\nYou wonder if you’ll lose it all.', 'The cycle’s endless, the struggle real,\nA life spent fighting just to heal.\nBut in the end, you break, you bend,\nAnd hope for the day this cycle ends.']"

They work unseen, behind closed doors,
On floors of factories, locked outdoors.
Their hands are calloused, their spirits low,
They give their all for what they don’t know.

They build the world, yet none can see,
The sacrifices they give to be free.
The invisible worker, the silent creed,
A life defined by an endless need.","['\nThey work unseen, behind closed doors,\nOn floors of factories, locked outdoors.\nTheir hands are calloused, their spirits low,\nThey give their all for what they don’t know.', 'They build the world, yet none can see,\nThe sacrifices they give to be free.\nThe invisible worker, the silent creed,\nA life defined by an endless need.']"

Once they walked with grace and pride,
But now they sit with eyes open wide.
Forgotten by the world they gave,
Now they wait with nothing to save.

Their hands once held the future bright,
But now they grasp for a final light.
The forgotten elder, left behind,
A story lost to passing time.","['\nOnce they walked with grace and pride,\nBut now they sit with eyes open wide.\nForgotten by the world they gave,\nNow they wait with nothing to save.', 'Their hands once held the future bright,\nBut now they grasp for a final light.\nThe forgotten elder, left behind,\nA story lost to passing time.']"

They smile, they laugh, they seem just fine,
But inside their hearts, there’s no sign.
Of the battle fought, of the tears that fall,
Of the pain they carry beneath it all.

So before you judge, before you say,
Take a moment to look their way.
You never know what’s under the mask,
What lies beneath the smile you ask.","['\nThey smile, they laugh, they seem just fine,\nBut inside their hearts, there’s no sign.\nOf the battle fought, of the tears that fall,\nOf the pain they carry beneath it all.', 'So before you judge, before you say,\nTake a moment to look their way.\nYou never know what’s under the mask,\nWhat lies beneath the smile you ask.']"

We chase a dream that’s out of reach,
A promise made by those who preach.
But the dream is distant, the path unclear,
And still we run, despite the fear.

The world is built on hopes and lies,
On promises we can’t recognize.
Yet still we chase, still we strive,
To make the dream, to stay alive.","['\nWe chase a dream that’s out of reach,\nA promise made by those who preach.\nBut the dream is distant, the path unclear,\nAnd still we run, despite the fear.', 'The world is built on hopes and lies,\nOn promises we can’t recognize.\nYet still we chase, still we strive,\nTo make the dream, to stay alive.']"

The voices rise, the protests roar,
A world that’s tired, yet wants more.
For justice, for truth, for a chance to be,
To end the silence, to make them see.

We stand together, side by side,
The power of change no longer denied.
The end of silence, a louder call,
For equality, for justice, for all.","['\nThe voices rise, the protests roar,\nA world that’s tired, yet wants more.\nFor justice, for truth, for a chance to be,\nTo end the silence, to make them see.', 'We stand together, side by side,\nThe power of change no longer denied.\nThe end of silence, a louder call,\nFor equality, for justice, for all.']"
